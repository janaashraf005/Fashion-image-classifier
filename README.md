# Fashion Image Classifier — TensorFlow & Neural Networks

This project implements a fully-connected neural network using TensorFlow to classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained using two different optimizers — Adam and SGD — to compare their performance.

## Features

- Uses the Fashion MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images)
- Data normalization for improved training
- Deep neural network architecture:
  - Flatten input layer
  - Hidden layers: 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 neurons
  - Output layer: 10 classes
- Trained with:
  - Adam optimizer
  - SGD optimizer
- Evaluation using accuracy metric on test data

## Technologies used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Neural Networks (Dense Layers)
